## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Less
- Jquery
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
The js part was really fun. I had a bit of a problem with overthinking, but taking 
the 'baby steps' advice helped alot. I use a bit of less, which I have never used before.
Jquery was very helpfull with those lengthy js DOM codes.
